# Financial-Planning

## Overview
In this project, I will create a finance planner prototype to predict my client's portfolio value in 30 years.
My client has a savings portfolio composed of the following cryptocurrencies, stocks and bonds:
`1.2` BTC and `5.3` ETH. `50` SPY (stocks) and `200` AGG (bonds).
My finance planner will use an API to find the price of ETH, BTC, SPY and AGG.
It will find out if my client has an emergency fund amount of at least $36000.
It will predict how much my client will have in 30 years by running a Monte Carlo simulation.

## Results
The current value of all your ETH is $9497.29
The current value of all your BTC is $31306.32
The current value of your SPY shares is $18711.00
The current value of your AGG shares is $19500.00

## Summary
My client has $79014.6. That is more than $36000.
There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $20000 in the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within in the range of $19087.09 and $309557.76
